HTTP request with a chunked body:

POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

7\r\n
Chunked\r\n
6\r\n
Encoding\r\n
0\r\n
\r\n

In this example:

    Transfer-Encoding: chunked indicates that the body is chunked.
    Each chunk starts with the size of the chunk in hexadecimal followed by \r\n.
    After the chunk size, there is a \r\n separator.
    The chunk data follows.
    The last chunk has a size of 0, indicating the end of the message.
    After the last chunk, there is an additional \r\n to indicate the end of the body.

So, the request body in this example consists of two chunks:

    Chunk size 7 (hex) followed by \r\n, then the chunk data "Chunked", followed by \r\n.
    Chunk size 6 (hex) followed by \r\n, then the chunk data "Encoding", followed by \r\n.
    The last chunk size 0 (hex) indicates the end of the message, followed by \r\n.

The entire body is followed by an empty line (\r\n\r\n) to indicate the end of the request.
